ABOUT THE PROJECT
The purpose of this project was to solve the problem of creating a random password.  It is a program designed to provide the user with prompts and requirements for a password they want to use.  Requirements include prompting the user if they want to use lower case or upper case characters, numbers, and special characters.

USAGE
To use the program, click on the "generate password" button.  You will then be prompted to select a password length of between 8 and 128 characters.  If no selection is made, you can click cancel and the program will exit.  You will then be prompted on the password requirements.  If you select OK, the selected password requirement will be used.  Seleting "cancel" on the prompt will not include that requirement in your password.  Once the prompts have completed, you will then be shown your random password.
